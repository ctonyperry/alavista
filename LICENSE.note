NOTE: The LICENSE file currently contains GPL-3.0 text.
According to the Phase 0 requirements, this should be replaced with AGPL-3.0.

The AGPL-3.0 license text can be obtained from:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt

The key difference is that AGPL-3.0 includes network use as "distribution",
requiring that modifications be shared even when used as a service.

Action needed: Replace LICENSE file content with AGPL-3.0 text.
